Feature: Adding new task to todo list
  In order to have tasks in todo list
  I need to be able to create a new task
  And save it to the list

  Scenario: Put one task into list
    Given I am on "/"
    When I am on path "/"
#    And I will fill form with new task name: "Some new task"
#    And I will submit the form
#    Then I am in the "/" path
#    And I can see "success" alert
#    And there is "Some new task" on the list
